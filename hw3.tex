Many non-European businesses are aiming to enter the single European market as they saw an unexploited potential there. There are three reasons for this interest. Firstly the non-European organisations are keen to do business in the European market because it is one of the leading investment destinations and the easiest places to set up and run a business. Secondly, the single European market provides foreign investors with an internationally competitive tax environment. Lastly there are lots of rich people living in the continent.
