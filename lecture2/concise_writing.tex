\section{How to be concise or bad habit?}

\subsection{Making some arguments}
for example, \underline{[It is clear that]} the US was not ready to engage in this conflict.

\subsection{Abundant words}
\underline{[In order]} to gain better results, we have to change the conditions.

\subsection{Not so concise}
\underline{[Due to the fact that]}, Instead using \textbf{Because/Since/As I was tired}, I missed my first class.

\section{Wordy but handy ways}

For the following phrase, use the right part that works better:

It is clear that		----  		delete it

It is a fact that 		----		delete it

The reason is that/because 		-----	due to

Despite the fact that			-----	although

At the present time				-----	today/currently

It is my opinion that			---- 	in my opinion

At that time					---- 	then

In most cases					---- 	usually

In order to						----	to

In the final analysis			----	finally

Subsequent to					----	after
